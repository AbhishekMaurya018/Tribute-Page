      <h2>HISTORY OF SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p1><a href="https://www.14gaam.com/history-of-sardar-vallabhbhai-patel.htm">SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL</a> <b>the iron-man of India</b> was born on 31st October, 1875, in a small village in Nadiad. His father Jhaverbhai Patel was a simple
          farmer and mother Laad Bai was a simple lady. From his childhood itself, Patel was a very hard-working individual. He used to help his father in farming and studied in a school at N. K. High school, Petlad. He passed his high-school
          examination in 1896. Throughout school he was a very wise and intelligent student. Inspite of poor financial conditions his father decided to send him to college but Vallabhbhai refused. Around three years he stayed at home, worked hard and
          prepared for the District pleader's examination, hence passing with very good percentage.</p1>
        <p2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is a historical figure who moves you to tears. Mostly these are tears of joy, for he achieved a thrilling Indian unity. Yet some are tears of pity, for the Sardar suffered and sacrificed much. Sardar Patel hated to
          work for anyone especially the Britishers. He was a person of independent nature. He started his own practice of law in a place called Godhara. Soon the practice flourished. He saved money, made financial arrangement for the entire family.
          He got married to Jhaberaba. In 1904, he got a baby daughter Maniben, and in 1905 his son Dahya was born. He sent his elder brother to England for higher studies in law. In 1908, Vitthabhai returned as barrister and started practising in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Bombay</a>. In 1909 his wife became seriously ill and was taken to Bombay for treatment Vallabhbhai had to go for the hearing of an urgent case and his wife died. He was stunned. He admitted his children in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary's_School,_Mumbai">St. Mary's school Bombay</a>, and he left
          for England. He became a barrister and retuned to India in 1913.</p2>

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p3>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel,one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat.Patel's date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers. He
          belonged to the Leva Patel gujjar community of Central Gujarat, although after his fame, the Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have also claimed him as one of their own.</p3>
        <p4>Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even
          as the barber charged with doing it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though,
          harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and become a barrister. Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations
          within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from her parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel – now an advocate – earned a reputation as a fierce
          and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in 1903 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1905. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from the Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he
          immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.</p4>
<hr/>
        <h2>Fight for self-rule</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Satyagraha in Gujarat</h3>
        <p5 ALIGN=LEFT>Supported by Congress volunteers Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel began a village-by-village tour in the Kheda district, documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a
          statewide revolt by refusing to pay taxes. Patel emphasised the potential hardships and the need for complete unity and non-violence in the face of provocation response from virtually every village. When the revolt was launched and tax
          revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide
          valuables and protect themselves against raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians. The government
          agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of taxes for a year, even scaling back the rate. Patel emerged as a hero to Gujaratis. In 1920 he was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress
          Committee; he would serve as its president until 1945.</p5>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy: 1931</h3>
        <p6 ALIGN=LEFT>Under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy" resolution was passed by the Congress in 1931.Maulana Azad, Jamnalal Bajaj, Patel (third from left, in the foreground), Subhash Chandra Bose and
          other Congressmen at Wardha.As Gandhi embarked on the Dandi Salt March, Patel was arrested in the village of Ras and was put on trial without witnesses, with no lawyer or journalists allowed to attend. Patel's arrest and Gandhi's subsequent
          arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujarat – districts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhi
          and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection,
          trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. In prison, the two
          discussed national and social issues, read Hindu epics, and cracked jokes. Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit. Gandhi's secretary, Mahadev Desai, kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel.When Gandhi embarked on a
          fast-unto-death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables, Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food.[35] Patel was later moved to a jail in Nasik, and refused a British offer for a
          brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in October 1933. He was finally released in July 1934.</p6>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Legal Battle with Subhas Chandra Bose</h3>
        <p7 ALIGN=LEFT>Patel's elder brother Vithalbhai Patel, died in Geneva on 22 October 1933.Vithalbhai and Bose had been highly critical of Gandhi's leadership during their travels in Europe. "By the time Vithalbhai died in October 1933, Bose had
          become his primary caregiver. On his deathbed he left a will of sorts, bequeathing three-quarters of his money to Bose to use in promoting India's cause in other countries. When Patel saw a copy of the letter in which his brother had left a
          majority of his estate to Bose, he asked a series of questions: Why was the letter not attested by a doctor? Had the original paper been preserved? Why were the witnesses to that letter all men from Bengal and none of the many other veteran
          freedom activists and supporters of the Congress who had been present at Geneva where Vithalbhai had died? Patel may even have doubted the veracity of the signature on the document. The case went to the court and after a legal battle that
          lasted more than a year, the courts judged that Vithalbhai’s estate could only be inherited by his legal heirs, that is, his family. Patel promptly handed the money over to the Vithalbhai Memorial Trust."</p7>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Quit India movement</h3>
        <p8 ALIGN=LEFT>On the outbreak of World War II, Patel supported Nehru's decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi's advice, as well as an initiative by senior leader Chakravarthi
          Rajagopalachari to offer Congress's full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence at the end of the war and installed a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral
          opposition to war, while Subhash Chandra Bose was in militant opposition to the British. The British government rejected Rajagopalachari's initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi's leadership again.He participated in Gandhi's call for
          individual disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps' mission in 1942. Patel lost more than twenty pounds during his period in jail.</p8>
        <center>
          <p9><i>The Governor of Burma boasts in London that they left Burma only after reducing everything to dust. So you promise the same thing to India? ... You refer in your radio broadcasts and newspapers to the government established in Burma
              by Japan as a puppet government? What sort of government do you have in Delhi now?...When France fell before the Nazi onslaught, in the midst of total war, Mr. Churchill offered union with England to the French. That was indeed a stroke
              of inspired statesmanship. But when it comes to India? Oh no! Constitutional changes in the midst of a war? Absolutely unthinkable ... The objective this time is to free India before the Japanese can come and be ready to fight them if
              they come. They will round up the leaders, round up all. Then it will be the duty of every Indian to put forth his utmost effort—within non-violence. No source is to be left untapped; no weapon untried. This is going to be the
              opportunity of a lifetime.</i></p9></center>

            <p11 ALIGN=LEFT>Historians believe that Patel's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel's organising work in this period is credited by historians with
              ensuring the success of the rebellion across India. Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar. Here he spun cloth, played bridge, read a
              large number of books, took long walks, and practised gardening. He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside. Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev
              Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year. But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing "fullest peace" for having done "their duty".[50] Even though other political parties had opposed the
              struggle and the British colonial government had responded by imprisoning most of the leaders of Congress, the Quit India movement was "by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857", as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill.
              More than 100,000 people were arrested and numerous protestors were killed in violent confrontations with the Indian Imperial Police. Strikes, protests, and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India.[51] When Patel was
              released on 15 June 1945, he realised that the British government was preparing proposals to transfer power to India. </p11>

            <h2>Statue of Unity</h2>
            <img src="https://mybestplace.com/uploads/2019/04/Statue-of-Unity-India-2.jpg"><br><br>
            <p12>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet), located in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first
              deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel was highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India with a major part of the former British Raj to form
              the single Union of India. In Gujarat the statue is found on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city of Vadodara.

              The project was first announced in 2010, and construction of the statue started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹2,700 crore (US$422 million). It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram
              V. Sutar and was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth.</p12>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">History</h3>
            <p13 ALIGN=LEFT>Narendra Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013 to mark the beginning of his tenth year as the chief minister of Gujarat.A society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was formed under the
              chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, to execute the project.Statue of Unity Movement was started in 2013 to collect the iron needed for the statue by asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments.By 2016, a total of
              135 metric tonnes of scrap iron had been collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the foundation of the statue after processing.A marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15 December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support
              of the project.</p13>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">Design and construction</h3>
            <p14 ALIGN=LEFT>After studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics chose a design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar.[a] The Statue of Unity is a larger version of a statue of the
              leader installed at Ahmedabad International Airport. Commenting on the design, Ram Sutar's son, Anil Sutar explains that, "the expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will as well as kindness that his
              personality exudes. The head is up, a shawl flung from shoulders and hands are on the side as if he is set to walk". Three models of the design measuring 3 feet (0.91 m), 18 feet (5.5 m), and 30 feet (9.1 m) were initially created. Once
              the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D-scan was produced which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China.</p14>
            <p15 ALIGN=LEFT> The Statue of Unity was built by a Public Private Partnership model, with most of the money coming from the Government of Gujarat. The Gujarat state government had allotted ₹500 crore (equivalent to ₹641 crore or US$84
              million in 2020) for the project in its budget from 2012 to 2015.[17][18] In the 2014–15 Union Budget, ₹200 crore (equivalent to ₹272 crore or US$36 million in 2020) was allocated for the construction of the statue.[19][20][21] Funds
              were also contributed by Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme. </p15>
            <p16 ALIGN=LEFT> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi">Narendra Modi</a>, then serving as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, laid the statue's foundation stone on 31 October 2013, the 138th anniversary of Patel's birth.Indian
              infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its lowest bid of ₹2,989 crore (equivalent to ₹41 billion or US$530 million in 2020) for the design, construction and maintenance of the statue. L&T
              commenced the construction on 31 October 2014. In the first phase of the project, ₹1,347 crore was earmarked for the main statue, ₹235 crore for the exhibition hall and convention centre, ₹83 crore for the bridge connecting the memorial
              to the mainland and ₹657 crore for the maintenance of the structure for a duration of 15 years after its completion. The Sadhu Bet hillock was flattened from 70 metres to 55 metres to lay the foundation of the statue</p16>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">Features</h3>
            <p17 ALIGN=LEFT>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue at 182 metres (597 ft). It rises 54 metres (177 ft) higher than the previous record holder, the Spring Temple Buddha in China's Henan province. The previous tallest statue in
              India was the 41 m (135 ft) tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The statue can be seen within a 7 km (4.3 mi) radius.The monument is constructed on a river island
              named Sadhu Bet, 3.2 km (2.0 mi) away from and facing the Narmada Dam downstream. The statue and its surroundings occupy more than 2 hectares (4.9 acres),[38] and are surrounded by a 12 km (7.5 mi) long artificial lake formed by the
              Garudeshwar weir downstream on the Narmada river.The statue is divided into five zones of which only three are accessible to the public. From its base to the level of Patel's shins is the first zone which has three levels and includes
              the exhibition area, mezzanine and roof. The first zone also contains a memorial garden and a museum. The second zone reaches up to Patel's thighs, while the third extends up to the viewing gallery at a height of 153 metres. The fourth
              zone is the maintenance area while the final zone comprises the head and shoulders of the statue.The museum in the first zone catalogues the life of Sardar Patel and his contributions. An adjoining audio-visual gallery provides a
              15-minute long presentation on Patel and also describes the tribal culture of the state.[10] The concrete towers which form the statue's legs contain two elevators each. Each lift can carry 26 people at a time to the viewing gallery in
              just over 30 seconds. The gallery is located at a height of 153 metres (502 ft) and can hold up to 200 people.</p17>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">Tourism</h3>
            <p18 ALIGN=LEFT>Over 128,000 tourists visited the statue in the 11 days after its opening to the public on 1 November 2018. The daily average tourist footfall at Statue of Unity during November 2019 reached 15,036, outpacing the Statue of
              Liberty (which attracts around 10,000 daily visitors on average). It has been included in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s ‘8 Wonders of SCO’ list.[45] In its first year of operation, the Statue of Unity attracted 2,900,000
              visitors and collected ₹82 crore (US$11.64 million) in ticket revenue. By 15 March 2021, 5,000,000 tourists visited the venue.</p18>
              <hr/>
            <h2>DEATH AND LEGACY</h2>
            <p19> Patel's health declined rapidly through the summer of 1950. He later began coughing blood, whereupon Maniben began limiting his meetings and working hours and arranged for a personalised medical staff to begin attending to Patel. The
              Chief Minister of West Bengal and doctor Bidhan Roy heard Patel make jokes about his impending end, and in a private meeting Patel frankly admitted to his ministerial colleague N. V. Gadgil that he was not going to live much longer.
              Patel's health worsened after 2 November, when he began losing consciousness frequently and was confined to his bed. He was flown to Bombay on 12 December on advice from Dr Roy, to recuperate as his condition was deemed critical. Nehru,
              Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Menon all came to see him off at the airport in Delhi. Patel was extremely weak and had to be carried onto the aircraft in a chair. In Bombay, large crowds gathered at Santacruz Airport to greet
              him. To spare him from this stress, the aircraft landed at Juhu Aerodrome, where Chief Minister B. G. Kher and Morarji Desai were present to receive him with a car belonging to the Governor of Bombay that took Vallabhbhai to Birla
              House.Among Patel's surviving family, Maniben Patel lived in a flat in Bombay for the rest of her life following her father's death; she often led the work of the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust, which organises the prestigious annual
              Sardar Patel Memorial Lectures, and other charitable organisations. Dahyabhai Patel was a businessman who was elected to serve in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) as an MP in the 1960s.For many decades after his
              death, there was a perceived lack of effort from the Government of India, the national media, and the Congress party regarding commemoration of Patel's life and work.[135] Patel was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
              civilian honour, in 1991.[136] It was announced in 2014 that his birthday, 31 October, would become an annual national celebration known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day).[137] In 2012, Patel was ranked third in Outlook
              India's poll of the Greatest Indian. <br><a href="https://www.14gaam.com/history-of-sardar-vallabhbhai-patel.htm">For more Information......</a> </P19>
